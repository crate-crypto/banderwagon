## Bandwagon - WIP

Bandwagon is a prime subgroup constructed over the bandersnatach group. It does not use the Decaf technique as that assumes that the Twisted edwards curve is complete, which bandersnatch is not. Note also that unlike Decaf, the 4-torsion subgroup is isomorphic to the Klein-4 group and not Z_4.
